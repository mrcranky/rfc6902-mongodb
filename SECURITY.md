## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email [mrcranky+rfc6902-mongodb@blackcompanystudios.co.uk](mailto:mrcranky+rfc6902-mongodb@blackcompanystudios.co.uk) if you wish to report a security issue.
Please correspond in English, providing details of the issue and why you believe it is a security concern that should remain private.
You should receive a response within at most two weeks. If you do not then it may be assumed I am no longer contactable and raising a public issue here on GitHub
and/or through the [npm process](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/179430064885/writing-quality-vulnerability-reports.html) is the best way to alert potential users of
the module that it contains outstanding issues.

If the vulnerability cannot be quickly (within a week) fixed, the maintainer(s) will at least endeavour to issue a new release as quickly as feasible, documenting 
the vulnerability so that users can add their own protection.
